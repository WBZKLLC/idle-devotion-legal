## 3. Accounts and Progress

The App may allow gameplay progress to be stored locally and/or synced via an account system if enabled.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials and for all activity under your account.

We do not guarantee that gameplay progress will always be recoverable (for example, device loss, uninstall, corrupted data, or platform restrictions). Where syncing is offered, we will make reasonable efforts to preserve progress.

We may also:

- Grant us a limited license to use it to operate, maintain, and improve the App and provide support

You may not submit unlawful, harmful, or infringing content.

(If your app does not have any user-generated content, this section is still safe and does not create obligations.)
